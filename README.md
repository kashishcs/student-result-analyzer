# Overview
Student Result Analyzer is a fully client-side web application that analyses student academic performance using structured data and presents results through calculated metrics and interactive visual dashboards.

The project is designed as a portfolio-ready Computer Science project demonstrating:
- Logical and algorithmic thinking  
- Front-end engineering  
- Data interpretation and visualization  
- Transforming raw academic data into meaningful insights

---

# Disclaimer
This project is built for educational and demonstration purposes and does not replace official institutional result management systems.

---

# Features
- Preloaded student academic data for analysis
- Automatic calculation of:
  - Total marks
  - Percentage
  - Grades
- Subject-wise performance breakdown
- Attendance-based performance insights
- Interactive charts for visual comparison
- Fully client-side execution (privacy-friendly)

---

# Tech Stack
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Chart.js**
- **GitHub Pages**

# Why Client-Side Only?
This project is intentionally built as a client-side application to:
- Keep the system simple and fast
- Avoid unnecessary data storage
- Focus on logic, calculations, and visualization
- Demonstrate core front-end and analytical skills

Backend integration is planned as a future enhancement.

# How It Works
1. Student data is loaded on the client  
2. Marks and attendance are processed  
3. Totals, percentages, and grades are calculated  
4. Subject-wise analysis is generated  
5. Results are displayed using charts and summary cards
